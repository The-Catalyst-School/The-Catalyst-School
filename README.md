# The-Catalyst-School

## Introductory text and overview to go here.The-Catalyst-School GitBook

Welcome to the prototype of The-Catalyst-School GitBook. This GitBook would collect and document all the content sources of The-Catalyst-School. 

Videos, images, Google documents, presentations, spreadsheets, links back to Discord posts and weblinks can all be embedded. 

The layout of this GitBook has been designed to match the layout of the The-Catalyst-School Discord server.

Access to editing on the GitBook can be divided into writers \(who can change content\) and readers \(who can read and comment\).

Open-source training is planned to compement the GitBook and GitHub platforms.

Details of the setup of this GitBook and The-Catalyst-School GitHub can be found here
