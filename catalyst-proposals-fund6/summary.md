## The Catalyst School

Project Catalyst proposals with the potential to bring the utmost value to Cardano and beyond might receive little to no votes as Proposers, Advisors, and Voters wrestle with existing challenges at several stages of their respective processes. Catalyst School is a hub actively striving to ensure that Project Catalyst flourishes, by empowering all participants with the necessary tools/knowledge and skills to reach their full potential. Project Catalyst is nothing without its community. As such, Catalyst School aims to ensure the community is sufficiently equipped to participate in Project Catalyst in meaningful, impactful and positive ways. This can in turn catalyse actions that feed into positive feedback loops that ripple within and beyond the Project Catalyst Ecosystem.
