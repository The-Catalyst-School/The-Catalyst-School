[Go to IdeaScale proposal &gt;](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Grow-East-Asia-Grow-Cardano/367250-48088)

### **Challenge question**

How do we grow the Cardano ecosystem in Southeast Asia?

The same way we do in Africa. Focused initiatives!

### **Why is it important?**

The Cardano community is heavily based in North America and Europe.

Growth elsewhere requires our support and initiative as a community.

### **How does success look like?**

A wide spectrum of people from Southeast Asia or with connections to Southeast Asia coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.

## **Key Metrics to measure**

The number and quality of funded proposals, as well as the impact, observed.

A steady increase in SPOs and transactions in Southeast Asia.

## **Challenge brief**

As in Africa, raising the awareness levels of regular people in Southeast Asia about blockchain technology and the Cardano protocol should be a priority for the Catalyst community. Providing the funding for those people who learn about our protocol to take advantage of the protocol and the support the community offers seems to me to be why we work together, doesn't it?

Within our community, we have some outstanding people that I've met in Vietnam working with us to grow the ecosystem. I'm aware of a group doing great things in Thailand as well. Let's give our fellow community members a funding category they can point to within their local communities as a means to take part in this revolution of technology.

The overwhelming majority of stake pools are based in North America and Europe. The Cardano protocol will be much more resilient and productive for people all around the world when the Catalyst community steps up and intentionally funds people around the world.

Addressing these different parts of the world directly through funding challenges such as this gives them access to our community and thereby a means of support as they engage with the Cardano ecosystem.

I'd like to be clear that there is no attempt on my part here to earn any reward for this proposal. I do not believe it needs a team for autonomous people to be able to make proposals that help people from this region to take part in the Cardano ecosystem. Teams will form organically, as they have in Africa.

I trust the community to make constructive comments and I trust the gradually improving assessment process to weed out charlatans.

The amount of funding I am proposing equals 6.25 % of the total available for Fund 7. My suggestion is that this is a nice percentage to use as a guide for future rounds when funding increases for all of the challenges that focus on specific regions.

**Requested funds in USD** 500000
