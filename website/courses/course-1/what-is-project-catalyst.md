### What is Project Catalyst?&#x20;

Catalyst is the biggest decentralized innovation fund in the world. It experiments on different topics and ideas revolving around governance and finances independent projects benefiting the Cardano Blockchain. Since Catalyst is so fundamentally different from what we know from institutions in the traditional economy, it is also widely referred to simply as an experiment.

While Catalyst proposals have to benefit the Cardano ecosystem, Challenge Settings are subsets with a more refined scope. Some Challenge settings might be more community-centric, like the Community Events - Challenge, others specify technicalities like the Dapps and Integration - Challenge. These Challenges also go through the Catalyst funding process every round for the next fund. Funding rounds take 3 months each and their official roles get paid by the Catalyst treasury.
