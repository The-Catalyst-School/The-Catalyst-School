Introduction To Catalyst - Funding Cycle (website edition)
{% endembed %}

The Funding Cycle consists of stages. Each can have its timeframe.

**Sharing Insights:** Share ideas about problems that need to be solved and possible ways to improve the Cardano and/or Catalyst ecosystem.\

**Submitting Proposals:** Submit a draft proposal to introduce your idea. The earlier you submit your proposal, the earlier youâ€™ll receive feedback to help you create the best version of your proposal.

**Refining Proposals:** All community members are encouraged to review proposals and provide comments to suggest ways that proposers may improve their idea. Mention similar projects to encourage cooperation. Publish your own proposals to a wider audience.

**Finalizing Proposals:** A submitted proposal can be edited anytime until the end of this stage.

**Assessing Proposals:** Evaluate the proposals based on impact, feasibility, and audibility. [Community Advisor Assessment Guide - Fund8 (official)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g-iZhDlKhUBZkui1uv8NVNfJC4oVD3JtR-P6Fue7XPU/edit)
