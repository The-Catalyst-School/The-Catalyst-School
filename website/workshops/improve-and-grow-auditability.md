## 1.0 Improve and Grow Auditability

### 1.1 Summary

Adapted from [Source](https://quality-assurance-dao.gitbook.io/f8-improve-and-grow-auditability/insight-sharing/insight-sharing)

[QADAO ](https://quality-assurance-dao.github.io)in collaboration with Catalyst School prepared an Insight Sharing Workshop as part of the funded proposal "[Insight Sharing Workshops - TCS](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384064)".

The workshops take place in Zoom meetings and will last up to 2 hours. One or two domain experts will be invited to participate, and one or two Catalyst School members will be there to provide all the required support. The meeting recording will be uploaded to [Catalyst School’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIPvRvMoxhmHLUuPPcsMmmg/videos).

The goal is to have an interactive, open conversation with everyone. Presenters decide the details of the presentation, but the idea is to leave space for everyone to interact and share their perspectives.
