### Summary

Challenge question: How might we create connections and collaboration between Cardano and other blockchains in the next six months?&#x20;

Why is it important? Interoperability of blockchains and multi-chain awareness guarantees shared success of the cryptoeconomy as a whole.&#x20;

What does success look like? Collaborative value creation between Project Catalyst and other communities. Both technical and non-technical initiatives are welcome.

THE GOAL: Letâ€™s create an enriching, open and safe environment, where people from different communities can find common ground and share knowledge, resources, skills, ideas and visions with one another.
