# About

### **The Catalyst School: what is it all about?**

The **Catalyst School** is a place created to **enhance the impact of Project Catalyst** as a whole by **improving the contribution of all its different players and roles**. We **onboard new members** and help **improving their skills** along the way, in any way they decide to engage with Catalyst: as a **Proposer**, a **Community Advisor**, a **Veteran Community Advisor** or **without any specific role** within the process. In order for **Catalyst** to **flourish** and **reach its full potential**, all these roles need to **give their best contribution** within the process.

We understand that **different people** prefer **different learning methods**. Therefore, the School aims to help the community through:

* Live **sessions** and **workshops**.
* **1-to-1** and **group support** in many **different languages**.
* Interactive **website**.
* **Other workshops** related to Catalyst.

The Catalyst School is **helping the community since the beginning of Fund 6**. We are doing that so we can **receive feedback** from the community and **improve our teaching methods and content** so we reach the **highest Return on Intention** we can.
