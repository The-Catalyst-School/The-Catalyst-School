### What is The Catalyst School

Catalyst School leverages the impact of Catalyst by improving the contribution of all its different players and roles through training & education.

### What is Catalyst

Project Catalyst is a series of experiments which seeks to generate the highest levels of community innovation.&#x20;

Catalyst is bringing on-chain governance to the Cardano blockchain by enabling the community to determine priorities for growth themselves. It also lets participants fund proposals which tackle Community set Challenges. Catalyst capitalizes on opportunities that arise in the life cycle of Cardano.

Project Catalyst is a continuous innovation fund which is deployed every three months. These funds will illicit ideas in the form of proposals from participants. Each proposal will focus around a challenge issued by the Project Catalyst team or the Project Catalyst community.&#x20;

The proposals will then go through a community refinement process where they are vetted for feasibility, auditability, and impact by a group of incentivized community advisors. Once the proposals have been finalized they will be voted on by the community and funds will be distributed in the form of ada to winning projects.
